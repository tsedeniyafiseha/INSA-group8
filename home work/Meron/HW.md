- No headers

### 2. HTTP/1.0
- Introduced request/response headers
- Added support for status codes
- Each request required a new connection

### 3. HTTP/1.1 (Most widely used)
- Introduced persistent connections (keep-alive)
- Added chunked transfers, cache control
- Still very common today

### 4. HTTP/2
- Binary protocol (faster and more efficient)
- Multiplexing (multiple requests at once)
- Header compression
